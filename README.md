**Hundreds of open tabs? A sluggish browser? Drowning in tab clutter?**

LeanTabs is the smart solution that transforms your browser back into a productivity powerhouse.

It is more than just a tab closer — it's your personal tab management assistant. Unlike simple "tab suspenders," LeanTabs intelligently closes old tabs but saves them instantly into a beautiful, searchable dashboard. Designed for power users who demand efficiency without ever losing an important link.

## 🚀 Why LeanTabs is the right choice for you

### 🎯 Focus on One Project at a Time
Clean up just your **current window or workspace** while leaving your other projects untouched. Need a full reset? You can also clean up all windows globally. You are in control!

### 🧹 One-Click "Tab Clean"
One click in the popup is all it takes. LeanTabs closes all unnecessary tabs instantly. The last few active tabs (customizable, e.g., 3) stay open so you can keep working without interruption.

### 🔒 Nothing is Ever Lost
Every closed tab is automatically saved into a dated and named **"Session"**. You can access your old research and link collections at any time via the dashboard.

### 🗂️ Powerful Session Manager
Open the "Saved Links" page to manage your sessions. Rename them, restore entire sessions with a single click, open individual links, or delete what you no longer need.

### ➕ Research Assistant
You can also add links manually to your sessions! Paste a URL, and LeanTabs **automatically fetches the page title** for you (e.g., converting a YouTube link into the video title).

### 🪟 Smart Restore
Restores your tabs exactly how you left them – respecting your **original window structure**. If a session had tabs from two different windows, LeanTabs can reopen them in two new windows.

### 🛡️ Multiple Safety Nets
*   **Automatic Backups:** Your data is safe, even if you close the browser.
*   **Whitelist:** Protect important sites (Email, Music, Calendar) so they are never closed automatically.
*   **Export/Import:** Move your data to another device easily.

### 🛡️ Privacy First
Your data belongs to you. LeanTabs stores all your sessions and links **locally on your device** (`chrome.storage`). We do not track you, we have no analytics, and we do not upload your data to any cloud servers.

> *Note: The extension only connects to the internet when you manually add a link (to fetch the title) or to load website icons.*

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

Not sure how LeanTabs fits into your workflow? Here are 5 scenarios based on its actual features:

### 1. The "Context Switcher" (Project Management) 🔀
You are working on "Project A" in one window/workspace but need to switch to "Project B" immediately.
*   **The Problem:** You don't want to lose your 15 open tabs for Project A, but you need the RAM for Project B.
*   **The LeanTabs Fix:** Set the scope to *"Current Window / Workspace"* and hit **Clean**.
*   **The Result:** Your current project is saved as a timestamped session (e.g., "Workspace 1 - 14:30"). You can now work on Project B in a fresh browser. Later, simply click **Restore Session** to bring Project A back exactly where it was.

### 2. The "Performance Booster" (Gaming & Editing) ⚡
You need maximum PC performance for a video call, a game, or video editing software, but your browser is eating 4GB of RAM.
*   **The Problem:** Closing the browser means losing your setup. Keeping it open slows down your PC.
*   **The LeanTabs Fix:** Click **Clean**. LeanTabs closes all tabs but intelligently keeps the **last 3 active tabs** open (customizable setting).
*   **The Result:** Your memory is freed up instantly, but you are not completely kicked out of your browsing flow.

### 3. The "Research Curator" (Active Collecting) 📝
You are researching a topic (e.g., "New Laptop") and collecting links from various sources over several days.
*   **The Problem:** Bookmarks are too permanent; keeping tabs open is too messy.
*   **The LeanTabs Fix:** Create a session (or use an existing one) and use the **"Add Link"** input field. Paste raw URLs from YouTube or Amazon.
*   **The Result:** LeanTabs automatically fetches the **page titles** for you. You get a clean, readable list of resources that you can edit, categorize, and restore all at once when you are ready to buy.

### 4. The "Device Migrator" (Work vs. Home) 💾
You finished your research at work and want to continue exactly where you left off on your home laptop.
*   **The Problem:** Syncing tabs via browser accounts often syncs *everything* or nothing specific.
*   **The LeanTabs Fix:** Go to Settings -> **Export All Data**. Save the JSON file to your cloud storage or USB stick. At home, click **Import Data**.
*   **The Result:** Your exact session history and saved links appear on your home machine, ready to be restored.

### 5. The "Monday Morning" Setup (Weekend Peace) 🧘
It's Friday afternoon. You have 3 different windows open with unfinished tasks, but you want to shut down your computer for the weekend.
*   **The Problem:** The anxiety of "Will I remember what I was doing?" makes you hesitate to close the browser.
*   **The LeanTabs Fix:** Run a global Clean. Go to the dashboard and **rename** the session to "To Do Monday".
*   **The Result:** You close the browser with zero guilt. On Monday, you see one clear session labeled "To Do Monday". If you had "Restore Window Structure" enabled, it even re-opens the tabs in their original window arrangement.

## 👥 Who is LeanTabs for?

*   **Developers, Designers & Researchers:** Stay focused by keeping only the relevant window or **Opera Workspace** active.
*   **Students & Knowledge Workers:** Automatically archive your research sessions and access them later for citations.
*   **Anyone suffering from "tab-itis":** Free your browser (and your mind) from digital clutter.
