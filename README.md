# LeanTabs – Smart Tab & Workspace Manager

**Hundreds of open tabs? A sluggish browser? Drowning in tab clutter? LeanTabs is the smart solution that transforms your browser back into a productivity powerhouse.**

LeanTabs is more than just a tab closer — it's your personal tab management assistant. Unlike simple "tab suspenders," LeanTabs intelligently closes old tabs but saves them instantly into a beautiful, searchable dashboard. Designed for power users who demand efficiency without ever losing an important link.

**Why LeanTabs is the right choice for you:**

*   🚀 **Focus on One Project at a Time:** Clean up just your current window while leaving your other projects in other windows untouched. Need a full reset? You can also clean up all windows at once. You are in control!
*   🧹 **One-Click "Tab Clean":** One click in the popup is all it takes, and LeanTabs closes all unnecessary tabs. The last few tabs (the number is customizable) stay open so you can keep working.
*   🔒 **Nothing is Ever Lost:** Every closed tab is automatically saved into a dated and named "Session." You can access your old research and link collections at any time.
*   🗂️ **Powerful Session Manager:** Open the "Saved Links" page to manage your sessions. Rename them, restore entire sessions with a single click, open individual links, or delete what you no longer need.
*   ➕ **Add Links Manually:** Use LeanTabs as a research tool. Paste URLs into your sessions, and it automatically fetches the page title for you.
*   🛡️ **Multiple Safety Nets:** Thanks to automatic backups and a full export/import feature, your data is always secure.
*   🪟 **Smart Restore:** Restores your tabs exactly how you left them – respecting your original window structure.
*   ✅ **Whitelist for What Matters:** Protect your most important sites (like email, calendars, or key documents) so they are never closed automatically.
*   ⚙️ **Fully Customizable:** In the settings, you decide exactly how LeanTabs should work for you.

**🛡️ Privacy First:**
LeanTabs runs 100% offline. Your data is stored locally on your device. No tracking, no analytics, no cloud.

**Who is LeanTabs for?**

*   **Developers, Designers & Researchers:** Stay focused by keeping only the relevant window / workspace active.
*   **Students & Knowledge Workers:** Automatically archive your research sessions and access them later.
*   **Anyone suffering from "tab-itis":** Free your browser and your mind from digital clutter.
